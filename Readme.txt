Well u will really like this window program.
It is so simple in its first version but then too uses many aspects of windows programming using c++..

Although the code doesn't has any errors  but u may contact me when needed...

To use the Software:

Simply compile the program and run the exe file created...
Or,
open the executable file from the bin directory...


About the Software:

It is made in Code::Blocks8.02 with MinGW compiler..
But i am sure that it will run on any compiler that supports windows programming,i.e.,has windows.h and other needed files and libraries...
